# Miracle-Piano-SoundFont v1.0 by DarkCecil

This Soundfont was created to allow the Miracle Piano Teaching System game to be emulated on PC using a keyboard other than the actual Miracle Piano.<br><br>
With this soundfont, all the instrument patches called by the game will be the correct instruments meant to be heard.<br><br>
I do not own an actual Miracle Piano (yet) so I went by the game manual's list of instrument names and made by best guess from there.<br><br>
All instruments in this SoundFont were sourced from GeneralUser GS v1.44 by S. Christian Collins. About 5 SFX patches were sourced from various royalty-free libraries on the net.<br><br>
If you have any comments or suggestions for edits, please feel free to e-mail me.<br><br>
Also, if you manage to figure out how to get the game's metronome synched up properly, please let me know. I feel the game's audio has latency.<br><br>
With my current setup, I have near zero latency with my keyboard, but I have to play AHEAD of the metronome by about 50ms in order for the game to give me a pass.
